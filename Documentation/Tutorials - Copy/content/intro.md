# Welcome to the Silica Developer Tutorials

These tutorials are designed to guide you step by step through the  
<span class="highlight">Silica diagnostics philosophy</span> â€”  
building systems that are explicit, auditable, and developerâ€‘friendly.

Youâ€™ll start with the essentials of **typed exceptions**,  
then progressively layer in **metrics**, **tracing**,  
and **versioning**. Each part is crafted to be practical,  
reproducible, and aligned with realâ€‘world subsystem design.

## How to Use This Guide

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Use the navigation on the left to move between parts.  
> Each tutorial opens here in the right pane, so you can focus on one  
> concept at a time without losing your place.

By the end of this series, youâ€™ll have not only a working  
*Document Importer* subsystem, but also a clear understanding of  
how to apply Silicaâ€™s principles to your own projects.
